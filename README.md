# Mapping Education Rates in Kansas Counties 
This is an interactive choropleth map to show the percentage of residents age 25+ with college degrees in five Kansas counties. Counties were chosen based on geography and population. From eastern Kansas, I use Johnson County (605,154), Shawnee County (179,053), and Wyandotte County (168,333). From central Kansas, I use Sedgwick County (520,467), and I use Riley County (72,602) from Western Kansas. This code can be adapted to include more, less, or completely different counties. 

As the "brain drain" becomes more prevalent in Kansas counties, these results should serve as a rudimentary investigation into the spread of young people after they graduate. Future work will also include layers of income in each tract and changes in % of young graduates in counties overtime. 

Feel free to check out the interactive maps here: https://nbviewer.org/github/snayhuh/KSCountiesEducationMaps/blob/main/KansasCountiesEducation.ipynb 

## The Code 
I use Jupyter Notebooks and specifically use Pygris to makes it fast to the process of getting Census shapefiles into Python projects. This package also allows the user to explore geographical and statistical entites (like roads and tracts). I explore some of the features of the package in the code.
