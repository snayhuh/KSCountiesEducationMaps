# Mapping Education Rates in Kansas Counties 
Created an nteractive choropleth map to show the percentage of residents age 25+ with college degrees in five Kansas counties. Counties were chosen based on geography and population. From eastern Kansas, we use Johnson County (605,154), Shawnee County (179,053), and Wyandotte County (168,333). From central Kansas, we use Sedgwick County (520,467), and we use Riley County (72,602) from Western Kansas. This code can be adapted to include more, less, or completely different counties.
